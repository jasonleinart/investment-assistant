# Product Requirements Document: Opportunity Detail Modal

## Introduction/Overview

The Opportunity Detail Modal is an educational feature that provides in-depth technical analysis information when users click on trading opportunities in the dashboard. This modal displays comprehensive technical setup details, agent reasoning, and visual analysis to help users understand why each opportunity was identified and learn from the technical analysis process.

**Problem**: Currently, users see only basic opportunity information (symbol, type, confidence) in the table view, but lack visibility into the underlying technical analysis that drove the opportunity identification.

**Goal**: Provide educational transparency into the technical research agent's decision-making process while maintaining the disclaimer that this is for educational purposes only, not trading advice.

## Goals

1. **Educational Transparency**: Show users the complete technical analysis behind each opportunity
2. **Learning Enhancement**: Help intermediate traders understand pattern recognition and indicator analysis
3. **Agent Visibility**: Demonstrate the AI agent's reasoning and decision-making process
4. **User Engagement**: Increase time spent understanding market analysis vs. just viewing results
5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices

## User Stories

1. **As an intermediate trader**, I want to click on an opportunity to see detailed technical indicators, so that I can understand what signals triggered this identification.

2. **As a learning trader**, I want to see the agent's rationale for identifying a setup, so that I can improve my own pattern recognition skills.

3. **As a user reviewing historical opportunities**, I want to see when and how each opportunity was detected, so that I can track the agent's performance over time.

4. **As a mobile user**, I want to easily view opportunity details on my phone, so that I can review analysis while away from my desktop.

5. **As a researcher**, I want to see technical charts with indicator overlays, so that I can visually confirm the patterns the agent identified.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Modal Functionality
1. The system must display a modal popup when users click on any opportunity row in the opportunities table.
2. The modal must show comprehensive opportunity details organized in collapsible sections.
3. The modal must be closable by clicking outside the modal area or using a close button.
4. The modal must prevent interaction with background content while open.

### Content Sections (All Collapsible)
5. **Technical Indicators Section** must display:
   - RSI values with interpretation (overbought/oversold)
   - Moving average relationships
   - MACD signals and crossovers
   - Volume analysis compared to average
   - Support and resistance levels

6. **Setup Rationale Section** must display:
   - Pattern type identification (e.g., "Mean Reversion", "Breakout")
   - Specific trigger conditions that fired
   - Confidence level with explanation
   - Risk factors identified

7. **Chart Analysis Section** must display:
   - Price chart with technical indicators overlaid
   - Pattern recognition highlights (support/resistance lines, trend lines)
   - Key price levels marked
   - Volume histogram overlay

8. **Timeline & Context Section** must display:
   - Detection timestamp
   - Responsible agent identification
   - Historical context (similar setup success rates)
   - Agent processing time and steps

### Data Presentation
9. The system must organize information in structured sections with expand/collapse functionality.
10. Each section must default to collapsed state to reduce initial information overload.
11. Technical data must be presented with intermediate-level explanations (no basic definitions, but context provided).
12. Values must include both numerical data and interpretive text.

### Responsive Design
13. On desktop (>768px width), the system must display as a centered modal with backdrop blur.
14. On mobile (<768px width), the system must display as a bottom sheet that slides up from bottom.
15. The modal must be appropriately sized for content while maintaining readability.
16. All text and interactive elements must be touch-friendly on mobile devices.

### Visual Design
17. The modal must maintain consistency with the existing dark theme and purple/blue gradient design.
18. Charts must be rendered with appropriate contrast for dark theme.
19. Collapsible sections must have clear visual indicators (expand/collapse arrows).
20. The modal must include appropriate loading states while data loads.

### Performance
21. Modal content must load within 2 seconds of opportunity click.
22. Chart rendering must not block modal display.
23. Modal animations must be smooth on both desktop and mobile.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Trading Execution**: This modal will not include any trading execution capabilities
2. **Real-time Updates**: Opportunity details will be static snapshots, not live-updating data
3. **Risk/Reward Calculations**: Options analysis and risk/reward metrics are handled by the Options Analyst agent
4. **Backtesting Tools**: Historical performance analysis beyond basic context
5. **Export Functionality**: No download/export capabilities in initial version
6. **Social Features**: No sharing, commenting, or collaborative features
7. **Advanced Charting**: No advanced chart tools, drawing capabilities, or custom indicators
8. **Multiple Opportunity Comparison**: No side-by-side comparison features

## Design Considerations

### UI/UX Requirements
- Modal must use existing component library (React with Tailwind CSS)
- Maintain glass morphism effects consistent with current design
- Use existing color palette: dark backgrounds with purple/blue accents
- Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### Chart Integration
- Utilize lightweight charting library (recommend Chart.js or similar)
- Charts must render server-side or cache for performance
- Support dark theme with customizable color schemes

### Mobile Optimization
- Bottom sheet must cover 80% of screen height maximum
- Swipe-to-dismiss gesture support
- Touch-optimized button sizes (minimum 44px)
- Prevent background scroll when modal open

## Technical Considerations

### Frontend Architecture
- Create reusable Modal component in React
- Implement responsive breakpoints using Tailwind CSS
- Use React state management for modal open/close state
- Integrate with existing API authentication

### Backend Integration
- Extend existing `/opportunities` API endpoint to include detailed technical data
- Ensure opportunity data model includes all required fields for modal display
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing opportunities table

### Data Structure
- Opportunity details must include technical_indicators, rationale, chart_data, and metadata objects
- Chart data should be pre-processed for frontend consumption
- Include agent_metadata for timeline and context information

### Performance Optimization
- Implement lazy loading for chart components
- Cache opportunity details to reduce API calls
- Use React.memo for expensive components

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- **Modal Open Rate**: >60% of users who view opportunities table click to view details
- **Section Exploration**: >40% of modal opens result in expanding at least 2 sections
- **Mobile Usage**: Modal functions properly on >95% of mobile devices tested

### Educational Value
- **Time Spent**: Average modal view time >45 seconds (indicates engagement with content)
- **Return Usage**: >30% of users open multiple opportunity details in same session

### Technical Performance
- **Load Time**: Modal opens within 2 seconds 95% of time
- **Error Rate**: <1% of modal opens result in errors
- **Mobile Performance**: No layout breaks on devices >375px width

### User Satisfaction
- **Accessibility**: Passes WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
- **Cross-browser**: Functions properly in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge

## Open Questions

1. **Chart Data Source**: Should charts be generated server-side and served as images, or rendered client-side with data APIs?

2. **Offline Capability**: Should modal content be cached for offline viewing of recently viewed opportunities?

3. **Future Agent Integration**: How should the modal accommodate additional agent types (Options Analyst, Manager) when they provide input?

4. **Educational Content**: Should we include links to educational resources explaining technical concepts?

5. **Feedback Mechanism**: Should users be able to provide feedback on opportunity accuracy for agent improvement?
